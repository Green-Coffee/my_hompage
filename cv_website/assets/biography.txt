Hi! I'm Minseung Shin, a software engineer specializing in EDA tool development at Siemens EDA, Korea.  

I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from KAIST in February 2025, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Youngsoo Shin.  

My research focused on SPICE acceleration and PDN impedance analysis, leading to several academic publications.

I'm particularly interested in the intersection of machine learning, and design verification/automation.

With a strong background in C/C++, EDA tools, I strive to develop high-performance and robust design tools for the semiconductor industry.
